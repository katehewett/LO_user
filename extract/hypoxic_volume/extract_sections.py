Code to extract hypoxic volumes - testing 

based off of Pmac tef extract_sections (get_one_section):
start old description:
Code to extract tef2 sections.

To test on mac:
run extract_sections -gtx cas6_v00Stock_uu0mb -ctag c0 -0 2021.07.04 -1 2021.07.06 -test True
run extract_sections -gtx cas6_v00Stock_uu0mb -ctag c0 -0 2021.07.04 -1 2021.07.04 -Nproc 10 -get_bio True

Doing this with subprocesses (Nproc = 10, on my mac) was about 2x as fast as doing
it sequentially within this program. The less-than-expected speedup may be because
each job only takes about a second, and there is overhead to spinning up new python
jobs because of imports.

Also, this is a memory-intensive calculation, so be careful about using Nproc > 10
(10 is the default in extract_argfun).

Performance: took about 1-2 sec per history file (Nproc = 10, on my mac).
- 58 sec per day with get_bio True (11 3-D variables)
- 24 sec per day with get_bio False (only salt)

Next we want to repackage these results into one NetCDF file per section, with all times.

We will follow the structure of the output of LO/tef/extract_sections.py so that we can mostly
recycle the subsequent processing code:

Variables in the NetCDF files:
- salt is hourly salinity in each cell (t, z, x-or-y) [same for all other variables]
- q is hourly transport in each cell (t, z, x-or-y)
- vel is velocity in each cell (t, z, x-or-y) positive to East or North
- DA is the area of each cell (t, z, x-or-y) hence: q = vel * DA
- z0 is the average z-position of cell centers (assumes SSH=0), useful for plotting
- DA0 is the average cross-sectional area of each cell (assumes SSH=0)
- h is depth on the section (x-or-y) positive down
- zeta is SSH on the section (t, x-or-y) positive up
- ocean_time is a vector of time in seconds since (typically) 1/1/1970.
