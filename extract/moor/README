#### OOI Coastal Endurance (CE) nomenclature + site designations: 
CE = Coastal Endurance

Oregon sites: CE01, -02, -04       [-03 skipped for potential future shelf break mooring location]

* Note: Site CE05 = Mobile Assets (MOAS) [CEO5MOAS, which are gliders and are not included here]

IS = Inshore
SH = Shelf 
OS = Offshore

SM = Surface Mooring (inshore, shelf, offshore)

PM = profiler mooring (offshore)

cabled assets**
PD = cabled deep profiler mooring (offshore)
PS = cabled shallow profiler mooring (offshore)
BP = benthic experiement package (shelf, offshore)

#### OCNMS nomenclature + site designations: 
Moored sensors were first deployed in 2000 and 10* lightweight, coastal moorings are currently 
maintained from Cape Elizabeth (“CE”) to Makah Bay (“MB”) at depths ranging from ~42m to ~15m.

North to south 
MB = Makah Bay 
CA = Cape Alava
TH = Teahwhit Head
KL = Kalaloch
CE = Cape Elizabeth

The mooring depth is listed with its site id, e.g., CE042 is placed at ~42m; 
KL027 at ~27m; and CE015 is placed at ~15m.

##### OCNMS job_names:
